## initial problem

Taking showers consumes hot water. Hot water is expensive. Knowing how much water your shower is consuming is necessary in order to minimize the hot water needed.

## general knowledge

- Water consumption can be calculated knowing an estimated flow rate for a given shower head.
- Water temperature an be estimated using well known human values or directly input if measured.
- Usage can be estimated using ``flow rate`` (gallons per minute) * ``time`` (minutes), which yields ``water consumption`` (gallons).

## initial solutions

- Measure time using a stop watch
- Measure time based on when the shower is turned on or off using the sound made
- Measure time based on the show handle position
