## initial problem

Taking showers consumes hot water. Hot water is expensive. Knowing how much water your shower is consuming is necessary in order to minimize the hot water needed.

## general knowledge

- Water consumption can be calculated knowing an estimated flow rate for a given shower head.
- Water temperature an be estimated using well known human values or directly input if measured.
- Usage can be estimated using ``flow rate`` (gallons per minute) * ``time`` (minutes), which yields ``water consumption`` (gallons).

## initial solutions

- Measure time using a stop watch
- Measure time based on when the shower is turned on or off using the sound made
- Measure time based on the show handle position

## questions

- how much water should I use to take a shower?
- what happens if I only use the water 25% of the time I'm in the shower?
- how much kWh does my water heater use to heat up the water I'm using in the shower?

## other thoughts

- set a goal of 25% water, the app tells you when to turn the water off
